The Borrowerapr tends to decreases as the Original loan increases. Cosmetic Procedure loans have the highest Borrowerapr quartile. 
Postive correlation exist between borrowerapr and lenderyield.

The Borrowerapr and lenderyield is postively correlated while both variable(Borrowerapr&lenderyield) is negatively correlated to prosperscore variable. 
The borrowerapr is lowest(0.07) at prosperscore of 10 during the Term period( 12 month loans)

## Key Insights for Presentation
I introduce each of the variables one by one. To start, I use the histogram plots of borrowerapr across variable to determine their disrtibution. 
I'm only looking at the borrowerapr plot here since it's the clearest example of how the categorical variable affect prosperloan payment. 
For the presentation, i focused on the relationship between LenderYield, Borrower APR and Prosperscore the explantory visualisation.
The relationship between Loanoriginalamount, Monthlyloanpayment and loanstatus will be further presented in the explantory visualisation.
